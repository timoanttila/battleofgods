# Battle of Gods

Battle of Gods is a personal project where I explored the worldâ€™s major religions. I built a website that includes articles and YouTube videos on the topic.

The frontend is built with Svelte, and the backend uses Cloudflare Workers and the Cloudflare D1 database. The site also includes login functionality and the ability to edit articles.

The website and REST API serve as good examples for new developers and projects.
